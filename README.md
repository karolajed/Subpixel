Opposite of _just another online course_. Learn by **doing, not rewriting** somebody else's solution.

IRL you don't get a code review before you start writing! Typical course can teach some basics quite fast, but it rarely forces to look for the solution somewhere else then it's contents. This hand-holding attitude is very harmful, since it prevents from developing very essential habit: asking questions and searching for answers. As it turns out professional developers most of the times learn form official documentation and Stack Overflow.[&sup1;](#sources) Just start writing, solve problems as you go and work like people who to earn their living out of coding.
